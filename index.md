# Elements

## Calcium

### Physical properties

- Its color is a metallic, silvery white.
- It is a solid at room temperature
- It is relatively soft
- Its density is 1.55 g/cm<sup>3<sup>
- It has a cubic crystalline structure
- As a metal, it is ductile, it can be beaten into extremely thin sheets.
- It is maleable as every metal, so it is capable of being bent
- Its melting point is at 851°C
- Its boiling point is  at 1482°C

### Chemcial properties

- Its symbol is	Ca
- It is an alkaline earth metal
- It is used as a deoxidizer in steel
- It has six isotopes
- Its electronegativity is 1
- Its oxidation states are +2, +1
- Among its common compounds are limestone, marble, and gypsum
- It will ignite if heated in presence of oxygen
- It will start a fast reaction with water, which will slow down as a calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) fil is created.
- It is highly reactive with acids

### Importance in the human body

Calcium is important for the process of bones and teeth strengthening, 99% is found there. It is also required in blood, muscles and other tissue, it is used in muscle contraction. It is required in nerve cells and also for blood clotting. This element is also needed to mantain a normal heart rythm. Concentration of calciums goes down as we age as it is released as the body need through sweat, skin cells and waste.

### Normal quantity in the human body

Age | Male | Female |	Pregnant | Lactating
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0–6 months | 200 mg | 200 mg |	  	 
7–12 months | 260 mg | 260 mg |	  	 
1–3 years | 700 mg | 700 mg |	  	 
4–8 years | 1,000 mg | 1,000 mg | 	  	 
9–13 years | 1,300 mg | 1,300 mg |	  	 
14–18 years | 1,300 mg | 1,300 mg |	1,300 mg |	1,300 mg
19–50 years | 1,000 mg | 1,000 mg | 1,000 mg |	1,000 mg
51–70 years | 1,000 mg | 1,200 mg |	  	 
71+ years |	1,200 mg | 1,200 mg |

### Deficiency

In the short term, indadequate intakes produce no symptoms. Hypocalcemia primarily comes from medical problems or treatments such as renal failure, removal of stomach and certain medications like diuretics. Symptoms include numbness, muscle cramps, convulsins, poor appetite, lethargy tinglin in the fingers and abnormal heart rythm. It can ultimately lead to death.

On the other hand, in the long term, causes osteopenia which can eventually lead to osteoporosis if untreated, increasing risk of fractures and it can also cause rickets.

### Excess

Hypercalcemia can, counterintuitevily, cause bone weakening, abnormal brain and heart functioning and obviously generate kidney stones. It is usually the result of overactive parathyroid glands but it can also come from cancer, some medications, and ingesting too much calcium and vitamin D supplements. It can cause nausea nd stomach upset, as well as confusion lethargy and fatigue, and even depression. Also it can produce palpitations, fainting and cardic arrythmia.

### Ingestion

Most common sources of calcium are milk, yogurt and cheese, all dairies. Kale, broccoli and spincach along with fortified grains. Other ways to take calcium are fruit juices, tofu and cereals.
