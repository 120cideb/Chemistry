### Importance in the human body

Calcium is important for the process of bones and teeth strengthening, 99% is found there. It is also required in blood, muscles and other tissue, it is used in muscle contraction. It is required in nerve cells and also for blood clotting. This element is also needed to mantain a normal heart rythm. Concentration of calciums goes down as we age as it is released as the body need through sweat, skin cells and waste.

### Normal quantity in the human body

Age | Male | Female |	Pregnant | Lactating
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0–6 months | 200 mg | 200 mg |	  	 
7–12 months | 260 mg | 260 mg |	  	 
1–3 years | 700 mg | 700 mg |	  	 
4–8 years | 1,000 mg | 1,000 mg | 	  	 
9–13 years | 1,300 mg | 1,300 mg |	  	 
14–18 years | 1,300 mg | 1,300 mg |	1,300 mg |	1,300 mg
19–50 years | 1,000 mg | 1,000 mg | 1,000 mg |	1,000 mg
51–70 years | 1,000 mg | 1,200 mg |	  	 
71+ years |	1,200 mg | 1,200 mg |

### Deficiency

In the short term, indadequate intakes produce no symptoms. Hypocalcemia primarily comes from medical problems or treatments such as renal failure, removal of stomach and certain medications like diuretics. Symptoms include numbness, muscle cramps, convulsins, poor appetite, lethargy tinglin in the fingers and abnormal heart rythm. It can ultimately lead to death.

On the other hand, in the long term, causes osteopenia which can eventually lead to osteoporosis if untreated, increasing risk of fractures and it can also cause rickets.

### Excess

Hypercalcemia can, counterintuitevily, cause bone weakening, abnormal brain and heart functioning and obviously generate kidney stones. It is usually the result of overactive parathyroid glands but it can also come from cancer, some medications, and ingesting too much calcium and vitamin D supplements. It can cause nausea nd stomach upset, as well as confusion lethargy and fatigue, and even depression. Also it can produce palpitations, fainting and cardic arrythmia.

### Ingestion

Most common sources of calcium are milk, yogurt and cheese, all dairies. Kale, broccoli and spincach along with fortified grains. Other ways to take calcium are fruit juices, tofu and cereals.

### Importance in the human body

Iodine is used to make thyroid hormones, which control the body’s metabolism and many other important functions. The body also needs thyroid hormones for proper bone and brain development during pregnancy and infancy. This element is especially important during early life stages.

### Normal quantity in the human body

Life stage | Amount
--- | --- |
Birth to 6 months | 110 mcg
Infants 7–12 months |	130 mcg
Children 1–8 years |	90 mcg
Children 9–13 years |	120 mcg
Teens 14–18 years |	150 mcg
Adults |	150 mcg
Pregnant teens and women |	220 mcg
Breastfeeding teens and women |	290 mcg

### Deficiency

People with low ingestion of iodine do not develop normally, today, experts say this is the leading cause of mental retardation, and less serious problems like lethargy and clumsiness. Also, iodine shortages slow down the thyroid gland, which will  make it swell up and also reduce metabolism speed, this is known as struma.

### Excess

Extremely high iodine presence in the body can also cause problems, as in shortages, it mostly depends on the thyroid gland, which will work too hastily, disturbing heart functioning, accelerating heartbets, and loss of weight due to metabolism acceleration.

### Ingestion

Main sources of iodine are fish, as cod and tuna, or shrimp. Dairy products and grains also play important roles as the major sources in American diets, along with iodized salt and processed food. Other sources are vegetables and fruits but the amount they contain directly depends on the soil and the fertilizers they grew with.

## Sulfur

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Sulfur-sample.jpg/1200px-Sulfur-sample.jpg)

### Physical properties

- It is soft
- It is bright yellow
- It is odorless, but due to impurities, it gets a smell similar to matches.
- It melts at 115 °C, but sublimes easily
- It boils at 445 °C
- It is an excellent electrical insulator
- It is not ductile
- It is not maleable
- Its density is 2g/cm<sup>3<sup>
  
### Chemical properties

- Its symbol is S
- It is very active
- Its electronegativity is 2.58
- It is a strong acidic oxide
- It is a chalcogen
- While forming sulfur dioxide, sulfur burns with a blue flame, creating a suffocating and irritating odor.
- It is not soluble in water, but in carbon dissulfide and other nonpolar organic solvents, such as benzene and toluene.
- Its oxidation states are +2, +4, +6, the last two being the more common.
- Sulfur reacts to every elemts except gold, nitrogen, iridium, iodine, tellurium, platunium and obviously the noble gases, and usually requires elevated temperatures.

### Importance in human body

It is the third most abundant element in the human body. It is an essential antioxidant and it is present in all living tissues, and a component in two important amino acids, methionine, which the body can not synthesize and must be acquired from the outside and cysteine, which requires sulfur at a steady rate and can be synthesized
The skin, muscles and bones have almost half the sulfur in the body. Keratin, the building block of hair and nails, contains sulfur, but is also required in cartilage and connective tissues, which are not as sturdy.

### Normal quantity in the human body

Although there is no official RDA for sulfur, it is a critical nutrient. Daily intake is usually 800 to 900 milligrams of sulfur per day, as certain health conditions, such as arthritis and liver disorders, may be improved by increasing the intake of sulfur to 1,500 milligrams per day.

### Deficiency

The most clear way to know whether you lack sulfur include wrinkles, sore muscles and joint pain, which may be an indication of a sulfur deficiency, however there are also acne, brittle nails and hair, convulsions, depression, obesity, heart disease, Alzheimer's and chronic fatigue. It is also vital for regulating your metabolism. Insufficient sulfur in your body may lead to insulin resistance, which is needed to regulate sugar levels.

### Excess

Arthritis and liver disordes can be produced due to higher intakes of sulfur. If these problems had existed before, the lack of this element will just potentiate them, creating even bigger problems.

### Ingestion

Sulfur-rich foods include eggs, legumes, whole grains, garlic, onions, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage, which are cruciferous vegetables or allium vegetables.

# Compounds

## Iron (III) oxide

![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Eu8AyBeFL.jpg)

### Common name

It is usually called like its chemical counterpart, iron oxide, or just rust.

### Chemical name

It is called iron (III) oxide, ferric oxide or hydrated ferric oxide

### Chemical formula

Fe<sub>2<sub>O<sub>3<sub>
  
### Importance in our surroundings

Iron oxide is a very common compound we see in our daily lives, it is the reddish layer than forms on top of iron products, but it is more of a problem than something we could find important, but it is also found in hemoglobin, which moves the oxygen in our body through blood, so it can also be useful, and recently has become an active research topic in nanomedicine as a way to treat tumors and detect other diseases.

### Advantages and disadvantages

The presence of iron oxide in the environment can lead to siderosis which is esentially neumoconiosis caused by the inhalation of iron filings or iron rust particles. And, in buildings, the presence of rust in the structure can weaken it, this can happen on every product made with iron and even steel, rendering them unusable.

### Where can it be found?

Iron (III) oxide is present everywhere, we see iron and steel structures everywhere and every place this is, rust will be also there, it is present in thermite, hemoglobin and some pigments too, obviously the reddish ones and their down or upgraded versions like orange and violet.

## Potassium nitrate

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Potassium_nitrate.jpg)

### Common name

It is usually refered as saltpeter, nitre, or Chilean saltpetre, which is sometimes also used for sodium nitrate
  
### Chemical name

Potassium nitrate is the official name give by the IUPAC

### Chemical formula

KNO<sub>3<sub>
  
### Importance in our surroundings

It only occurs naturally as a mineral niter, used as a natural source of nitrogen. It is used in several fertilizers and rocket propellants, fireworks and gunpowder. During the Middle Age it was commonly used as a food preservative and it is still used in a minor proportion nowadays.

### Advantages and disadvantages

It is used in some fertilizers, and to cause explosions that will be used by a machine, such as in gunpowder, rocket propellants or fireworks. Regarding the body, it is used in some toothpastes, as it is more careful with sensitive teeth. It has also been used to relieve asthma symtomps. It can also be useful to treat some kidney-related problems like cystitis, pyelitis and urethritis. And it can also help treating high blood pressure.

### Where can it be found?

It naturally occurs as mineral niter, but their uses in the industry allow us to found it in products in our house like toothpaste, fertilizers and sometimes in our food, as preservatives.

# Reflections

## Zenia

Elements are very important for the correct function of the human body. We have to be concious that everything in excess is harmful, so that is why we have to consume elements in a control way.

## Javier

The elements are important in the composition of our body. We need some quantities of some elements in order to continue the well-functioning of our bodies, but with some elements in pure state and in high amount we can get intoxicated or worse.

## Aaron

The elements are important for our body, our body needs of them too keep functioning, but the elements in much quantity can be dangerous to us, that is why we need to be careful in what we eat.

## Alejandro

Elements are really basic in our lives, so much, even our bodies depend on elements. If elements didn't exist, our lives would be pretty different or not even real, because, thanks to elements, multiple people have made discoveries that served as a base for what we use and depend on today.

## Leonel

Elements are necessary for everything we need to use, like body necessities like breathing to architecture like constructing buildings and houses. Chemistry is now focusing in nanotechnology, which could facilitate a lot of things for the human kind

## Roberto

There are some elements that are very important for us to have in our daily diet, indirectly as part of many foods, because we require them in order for our body to function properyl. But we should be carfeul, because if we take too much or too little it can damage our health instead. Also there are elements and compound in which most of our industry relies, so we also have to value them as they form an important part of our live through the devices and products we use.
